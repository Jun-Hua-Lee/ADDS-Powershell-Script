# ADDS Bulk Users Import Using PowerShell Script

This PowerShell script facilitates the bulk import of users into Windows Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) from a CSV file. The script reads user data from the `users.csv` file and creates new user accounts in Active Directory based on the details provided. I made this as a part of my school project, edited from online articles.

## Installation
1. Download or copy the script file `bulk-import.ps1` and `users.csv` to your local machine.
2. Ensure the `users.csv` file is in the same directory as the PowerShell script.

## Usage
1. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script and the `users.csv` file.
3. Run the script
